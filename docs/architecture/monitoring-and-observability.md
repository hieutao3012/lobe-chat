# Monitoring and Observability

To ensure the stability and performance of Box Chat AI, we'll implement comprehensive monitoring and observability measures that build upon LobeChat's existing infrastructure.

## Monitoring Stack

- **Frontend Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics for web vitals and user experience metrics
- **Backend Monitoring:** Vercel Serverless Function monitoring for API performance
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring:** Lighthouse CI for automated performance testing

## Key Metrics

**Frontend Metrics:**
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- JavaScript errors and unhandled exceptions
- API response times and failure rates
- User interactions and feature usage

**Backend Metrics:**
- Request rate and response time percentiles
- Error rate and types of errors
- Database query performance
- API endpoint usage and performance

For the MVP, we'll leverage Vercel's built-in analytics and monitoring capabilities, with plans to integrate more comprehensive monitoring tools as the application evolves.
